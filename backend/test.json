{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are an AI assistant specialized in generating web scraping code based on provided DOM sections and user specifications. Your task is to analyze the given HTML structure and create efficient, accurate scraping code using the specified library (Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer) in either JavaScript or Python.\n\nInput:\n\nA section of HTML DOM (which may be large and provided in chunks)\nUser's data extraction requirements\nPreferred scraping library (Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer)\nPreferred programming language (JavaScript or Python)\n\nContext:\nThe DOM content provided represents only the most relevant sections of the webpage, not the entire site. These sections have been extracted based on their relevance to the scraping task. Your goal is to focus on these specific sections to generate the most efficient scraping code.\n\nOutput:\nGenerate web scraping code that:\n\nNavigates to the correct elements within the provided DOM structure\nExtracts the specified data accurately\nHandles potential errors and edge cases\nFollows best practices for the chosen library and language\n\nOutput Format:\nYour response must strictly adhere to the following format:\n[SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS]\nAny necessary setup instructions (e.g., library installation)\n[/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS]\n\n[SCRAPING_CODE]\n# Generated scraping code here\n# Include comments explaining key steps\n[/SCRAPING_CODE]\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. Process DOM chunks as they are received. Do not wait for all chunks before beginning analysis.\n2. Focus on the provided DOM sections, understanding that they represent the most relevant parts of the webpage for the scraping task.\n3. Analyze the DOM structure carefully to identify the most efficient selectors (e.g., IDs, classes, XPaths).\n4. Prioritize robust and maintainable code that can handle variations in the DOM structure.\n5. Include comments explaining key steps in the scraping process.\n6. If the DOM structure is unclear or ambiguous, state your assumptions and proceed with the best possible approach.\n7. Suggest improvements or alternative approaches if you identify more efficient methods.\n8. Ensure all code is contained within the [SCRAPING_CODE] tags.\n9. Provide a clear, concise summary within the [SCRAPING_SUMMARY] tags, including any assumptions made about the DOM structure.\n10. Include any necessary setup instructions within the [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS] tags.\n\nRemember:\n- The provided DOM sections are pre-selected for relevance, so focus on these specific parts.\n- Your code should be adaptable to potential variations in the full website structure.\n- Emphasize error handling and robustness, as the full webpage may contain elements not present in the provided sections.\n- Insert the correct URL that comes from the user prompt in the finished code\n\nExample User Prompt:\n\"Extract all product names and prices from the provided e-commerce page"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Relevant DOM Sections:\n\nChunk 1:\nSimilarity: 0.0000\nClass: \n\n<next-route-announcer>\n\nSimilarity: 0.0000\nClass: content__CardContentHeadline-sc-1nrnigk-1 jMzOuf\n\n<div class=\"['content__CardContentHeadline-sc-1nrnigk-1', 'jMzOuf']\">\n<h3 class=\"['content__CardContentTitle-sc-1nrnigk-3', 'cqSeTS']\">\nCode Jams\n\nSimilarity: 0.0000\nClass: doclayout__Wrapper-sc-1qx8par-1 fFNJso\n\n<div class=\"['doclayout__Wrapper-sc-1qx8par-1', 'fFNJso']\">\n<div class=\"['pages__FlexContainer-sc-1o7d36l-0', 'dEUHOs']\">\n<div class=\"['flex__FlexContainer-sc-8vtkwv-0', 'eNunqU']\">\n<h1>\nTech with\n<span>\nTim\n<h2>\nyour ultimate resource for learning to code\n<div class=\"['pages__CardsContainer-sc-1o7d36l-2', 'ffvwXr']\">\n<a class=\"['content__CardContentContainer-sc-1nrnigk-0', 'iSmWKS']\">\n<div class=\"['content__CardContentHeadline-sc-1nrnigk-1', 'jMzOuf']\">\n<h3 class=\"['content__CardContentTitle-sc-1nrnigk-3', 'cqSeTS']\">\nTutorials\n<p class=\"['content__CardContentDescription-sc-1nrnigk-4', 'iCJMd']\">\nClear, concise, and easy to follow with step by step instructions to guide you through each lesson.\n<a class=\"['content__CardContentContainer-sc-1nrnigk-0', 'iSmWKS']\">\n<div class=\"['content__CardContentHeadline-sc-1nrnigk-1', 'jMzOuf']\">\n<h3 class=\"['content__CardContentTitle-sc-1nrnigk-3', 'cqSeTS']\">\nCode Jams\n<p class=\"['content__CardContentDescription-sc-1nrnigk-4', 'iCJMd']\">\nPut your skills to the test with our coding challenges for a chance to win real cash prizes!\n<a class=\"['content__CardContentContainer-sc-1nrnigk-0', 'iSmWKS']\">\n<div class=\"['content__CardContentHeadline-sc-1nrnigk-1', 'jMzOuf']\">\n<h3 class=\"['content__CardContentTitle-sc-1nrnigk-3', 'cqSeTS']\">\nCourses\n<p class=\"['content__CardContentDescription-sc-1nrnigk-4', 'iCJMd']\">\nFor those who want to dive deeper in the world of programming and become true Software Engineers!\n<div class=\"['flex__FlexContainer-sc-8vtkwv-0', 'eHtjBp']\">\n<h2>\nBrowse through a variety of topics\n<div class=\"['pages__TagList-sc-1o7d36l-1', 'fpZjyC']\">\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nPython\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nJava\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nGame Development\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nMachine Learning\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nWeb Development\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nDiscord.py\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nBeginner\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nIntermediate\n<a class=\"['tag__TagContainer-sc-3f52y0-0', 'fPNUsx']\">\nAdvanced\n<div class=\"['flex__FlexContainer-sc-8vtkwv-0', 'eHtjBp']\">\n<h2>\nMeet Tim Ruscica\n<div class=\"['about__AboutContainer-sc-xamder-0', 'ijKBan']\">\n<div class=\"['flex__FlexContainer-sc-8vtkwv-0', 'gWtvov']\">\n<div class=\"['about__Heading-sc-xamder-3', 'kRtxBv']\">\n<h2>\n<p>\nI'm Tim Ruscica, a software developer and content creator behind the Tech With Tim YouTube channel.\n<p>\nI love sharing my knowledge and helping people achieve their goals.
